# Side Project: Youtube Downloader with Pytube & Tinker

This project serves as a learning jorney to deepen my understanding of various Python topics and software development practices

> [!CAUTION]
__Status : Blocked__ â›”

## Objectives ðŸŽ¯

- __Integrating libraries__: Working with external libraries such as [Pytube](https://github.com/pytube/pytube) for downloading Youtube videos and [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/es/3/library/tkinter.html) for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
- __Mastering Asynchronous Programming__: Learning how to implement asynchrony in Python to avoid blocking operations.
- __Following Python Best Practices__: Writing code that adheres to [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/), the style guide for Python, to ensure clean and maintainable code.
- __Reading documentation__: Enhancing my skills in reading and understanding library documentation to fully leverage their features. 

## Why the Project Was blocked? â›”
The main reason for halting development is due to the limitations of the *Pytube* library.
- __Lack of Maintenance__: Pytube has not been updated since 2011, leading to compatibility issues.
- __Frequent Breakages__: Whenever Youtube updates its API or makes change to its website, Pytube often breaks. This results in unpredictable behavior:
  - One day the library works fine, and the next day it doesn't.


## What Has Been the Biggest Challenge? ðŸ—¿
Boxing against Pytube ...

Working with Pytube has been like going toe-to-toe with an unpredictable opponent. One of the most significant challenges has been handling video resolution selection:

ðŸ¥Š __Progressive vs DASH Streams__: While Progressive streams come with video and audio combined, they are limited to lower resolutions (maxing out at _720p_). For higher resolutions like _1080p_ or above, I had to work with DASH streams, where video and audio are separate files that need to be downloaded and merged.

ðŸ¥Š __Implementing DASH Stream Handling__: Using __DASH__ required extra steps to manually download the separate video and audio streams, then merge them using tools like `ffmeg`. This added complexity to the code and introduced new challenges, such as managing dependencies and ensuring seamless merging.

ðŸ¥Š __User Experience Considerations__: Allowing users to choose the resolution meant balancing, simplicity and functionality. I had to desing the application to account for both _Progressive_ and _DASH_ streams while keeping the interface user-friendly.


Despite these obstacules, figuring out how to deal with different stream types was a rewarding learning experience,deepening my understanding of video formats and programmatic video processing.

## What have you learned? ðŸ’¡

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/845cd57a-3366-45f5-bfa5-6d635aeceb97)

- How to design and set up an GUI (Tkinter)
- How streams works
- Difference between Progressive vs DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP)
- Threading and Asynchronous process (well ... something ... around 1%, I hate it)
- Events
- Buffering
- Lambdas function
- How the progress bar works and synchronizes with a downloading stream


## Next steps or ideas ðŸš€
1. Find alternatives to Pytube ([yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) is popular, but its api ... no)
2. Choose the directory where to save the content
3. Download only audio from videos
4. Download playlists


__Techie Stack__ ðŸ’»:
- Python ([Pytube](https://github.com/pytube/pytube))
- [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/es/3/library/tkinter.html) (GUI)
